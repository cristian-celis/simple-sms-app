The app is structured around **Clean Architecture** with the following layers:

### **1. Data Layer**
- Handles SMS sending, receiving, and local storage.
- Includes:
   - **DAO**, **Entity**, and **Database** classes for managing SMS persistence using **Room**.
   - Configuration for **FTS4** to enable advanced search capabilities.

### **2. Domain Layer**
- Defines the core business logic and data models.

### **3. Presentation Layer**
- Contains:
   - The **main screen** for listing sent and received SMS with search functionality.
   - A **dialog** for composing and sending SMS.
   - A **ViewModel** using **StateFlow** to manage UI state and communicate with the business logic.

### **4. DI (Dependency Injection)**
- Utilizes **Dagger Hilt** for dependency injection to ensure a clean and testable architecture.

### **5. Utils**
- Houses utility classes, such as constants and format converters.

## üîÑ Workflow
1. **Send SMS**: Users can compose and send SMS using a custom dialog. The app confirms delivery status using a dynamic broadcast receiver.
2. **Receive SMS**: Incoming SMS messages are processed via a dynamic broadcast receiver and stored locally.
3. **Search SMS**: Users can perform advanced searches using full-text search (FTS4) for both sent and received messages.
4. **View SMS**: Sent and received SMS are displayed in separate, organized sections.
